# Environment
Most of the tests were made on a 2-node kubernetes cluster set up with minikube.
The scenarios for each test available on this repo can be replicated by applying the scenario yaml file:

```shell
kubectl apply -f /path-to/scenario.yaml
```


The yaml files can also be generated by using the weaver.yaml files for each configuration.

```shell
waver-kube deploy  /path-to/weaver.yaml
```

The yaml files on this repo were altered from the auto-generated configurations in order to specify the nodeName parameter for some services.
